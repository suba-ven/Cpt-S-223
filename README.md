# I had some confusion on Problem 3
I understand that the node had to be split, but wasn't fully sure on how to go about sorting the data afterwards. We only covered 3 cases for insertion in class, and none of them went into how to split the root node. Please take this into account when grading 3a and 3b! Thank you.
